# ASSESSING CREDIBILITY & TRENDS IN EDUCATION TWEETS (2022-2023)

## Objective

To assess the viability of Twitter as a credible information source for identifying emerging trends in the education sector. It involved an exhaustive examination of approximately 100 million education- related tweets (~500GB) stored in Google Cloud Storage.

## Key Insights

- Twitter efficiently flags "hot" educational topics via sudden influxes of related tweets. Predominantly, non-institutional users use Twitter to share their personal education-related experiences and perspectives.
- Tweet volumes often spike due to non-educational events, sometimes only correlating with new educational trends.
- The existence of 'echo chambers' is prominent, with many tweets being retweets or copies.
- The geographical distribution of tweets varies, with certain regions more active during specific educational issues.
- Observed gaps in data collection highlight the need for improved strategies in data gathering.

## Impact of Analysis
This analysis will enable us to leverage Twitter better for educational trend tracking, informing policy decisions, academic research, and education-focused marketing strategies.
